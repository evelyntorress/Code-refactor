# -Horiseon Web Site-
## Description

The goal of the following project was to make the site more web accessible.
Implementing a codebase that follows accessibility standards, so the site is optimized for search engines.




- The source code has semantic HTML elements.
- The structure of the HTML elements follows a logical structure.
- The image elements have alt attributes defined.
- The heading attributes have sequential order.
- The title element is concise and descriptive.




There was a link not working properly. Is fixed. All links are functioning correctly now.

There is a semantic structure of the HTML elements.

Comments are included before each element or section of the page.

## The efficiency of the CSS by consolidating the selectors and properties:

- The CSS for h3 and h2 was changed, they were put all together because this way is more concise and there is no need to do a separated one for each title since are all h3 or h2.

- The margin-bottom and color properties were added to the benefits class, instead of having them added all in a different class. Since are the same values they can go all together.

- The images of the links have all the same property, so I made them more concise.
